Exercise 5 - basic git Action pipline
===================================

-   In your repository on GitHub.com, create a workflow file called github-actions-demo.yml in the .github/workflows directory. To do this:

-   If the .github/workflows directory already exists, navigate to that directory on GitHub, click Add file, then click Create new file, and name the file github-actions-demo.yml.

-   If your repository doesn't have a .github/workflows directory, go to the main page of the repository on GitHub, click Add file, then click Create new file, and name the file .github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml. This creates the .github and workflows directories and the github-actions-demo.yml file in a single step.

```
